Problem statements

Many small food businesses, beginners in programming, and educational environments require an easy and efficient method of simulating or managing a food-ordering process without using any complex applications or involving an external system. Manual note-taking or ordering verbally may result in errors, shortcomings, or miscalculations at the time of billing.

There is a need for a lightweight, console-based food ordering system that:

Clearly shows a food menu.

Easy selection of items by the users

Validates user input to prevent errors

Automatically calculates the total bill

Provides a clean and organized order summary

This is addressed by the Panache Food Ordering App, which provides a simple Python-based solution to simulate core functions for the purpose of ordering food. It helps learners with practical Python concepts, such as loops, functions, dictionaries, error handling, and user interaction, and can serve as a prototype for small-scale ordering workflows.



Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:

⦁	Showing a fixed menu of food items with their numbers, names, and prices.

⦁	Allowing users to choose multiple items by console input.

⦁	Validating user inputs to avoid errors.

⦁	Storing orders and calculating the total bill.

⦁	Show a nicely formatted final order summary.

* Running the project entirely from a terminal/console without additional libraries.

* Online ordering capability

Target Users

This project is designed for:

• For beginners learning loops, functions, and dictionaries

⦁	Students needing a mini-project for coursework

⦁	Small food businesses looking for a simple prototype to take orders
